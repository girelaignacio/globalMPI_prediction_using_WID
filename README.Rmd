# Global Multidimensional Poverty Prediction Using World Bank Indicators: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains the codes and auxiliary files to reproduce the results of the paper "Global Multidimensional Poverty Prediction Using World Bank Indicators: A Machine Learning Approach" (2024) García Arancibia, R.; Girela, I. & González, D.

## Introduction

To reproduce the results you can install the version of this project from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("girelaignacio/globalMPI_prediction_using_WID")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
devtools::load_all()
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
